# Dt. Dental Website Design

Dt. Technologies is a local software company that is focused in creating solutions for dental practices.

It's main product is the software _Dt. Dental_ which allows a dentists to manage his/her practice. From the creation of appointments to the management of clinical records.

I was in charge of managing and the design of this website. So I played two roles: Scrum Master and Designer.

My activities in this project where:

- Gather requirements for the creation of the website
- Develop wireframes with the product owner
- Lead meetings and Stand-ups
- Web Design
- Quality Assurance

The current site can be viewed in [https://dtdental.co](https://dtdental.co), and here are the design assets:
