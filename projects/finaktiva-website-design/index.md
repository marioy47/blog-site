# Finaktiva Website Design

This was a simple 1 week project that required a very simple website design for a local fin-tech called [Finaktiva](https://finaktiva.com)

The client wanted a site that followed their design language (that was created by a specialized branding company) and that was as clean as possible.

For this project I the following:

1. Coordinated the development and design using the _Scrum Framework_.
2. I took care of the design of the site following the client's design language.
3. Co-developed this site. Specifically the interest rate calculator.

## Tools and Tecnologies

The site is done using **WordPress**, the animations are done using the **AOS** _js_ library and the _Loan Calculator_ was created using vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery).

For the design I used [Figma](https://figma.com) and for the icons I used the SVG files that can be downloaded from the [material.io](https://material.io) website.

For coordinating the work I used trello.

## Final Design

The current site has change a bit and can be seen in [https://finaktiva.com](https://finaktiva.com), but here is the original design in [Figma](https://figma.com).
