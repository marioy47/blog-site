# Finaktiva Website Design

I designed and co-developed this site for a local fin-tech.

The site is done using WordPress, the animations are done using the AOS _js_ library and the _Loan Calculator_ was created using vanilla javascript from scratch.

The current site has change a bit and can be seen in [https://finaktiva.com](https://finaktiva.com), but here is the original design in [Figma](https://figma.com).
