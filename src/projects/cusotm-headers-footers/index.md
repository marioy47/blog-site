# "Custom Headers & Footers" WordPress Plugin

![Cover Image](custom-header-footer-featured.png)

This plugin was made for the company [iHealthSpot](https://ihealthspot.com) so the marketing team could add any kind of tag on the header or footer of a page.

The main reason to create it as a new plugin instead of using one of the existing ones where:

- There are tags used in Medical Directories in the US that require to add content on both header and footers of a page
- The existing plugins allowed you to add content globally and not per page
- The existing plugins did not allow you to set "firing priorities"
- The marketing team wanted _syntax highlight_ when adding code
- The existing plugins had issues with older versions (version 4.9) of wordpress.

Here is the live coding sessions of the development:
