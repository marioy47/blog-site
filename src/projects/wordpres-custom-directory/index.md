# "Custom Directory" WordPress Plugin

![Cover Image](wp-custom-dir-featured.png)

This is a plugin I did as a personal project that allows you create a list of items (like personal profiles, definitions, reference terms, etc.) and have them embedded in any page.

It also allows you to have a live search for the list and support _Advanced Custom Fields_ for additional information.

Here is the live coding sessions for the creation of the plugin.
